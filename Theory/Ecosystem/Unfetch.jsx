// Tiny: about 500 bytes of ES3 gzipped
// Minimal: just fetch() with headers and text/json responses
// Familiar: a subset of the full API
// Supported: supports IE8+ (assuming Promise is polyfilled of course!)
// Standalone: one function, no dependencies
// Modern: written in ES2015, transpiled to 500b of old-school JS

//? npm i unfetch
